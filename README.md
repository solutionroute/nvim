# nvim
A simple, hopefully understandable, Neovim configuration in Lua.

## Features

- Not too many features but enough for comfortable Go, HTML, CSS, Javascript
  and Markdown work
- Auto-plugin-install via Packer
- Language support via Mason and others; some Go tweaks
- Git integration
- Auto completion
- Telescope
- Whichkey menus

## Status

I've moved much of my old functionality over to this cleaner configuration but
as of Dec 11 2022 still have some mappings/Whichkey setup to complete.
